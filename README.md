# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  Louise is looking at all the different Kickstarters based on multiple factors to include, goals, pledged, outcomes, categories, launch date, and more. Louise has asked to assist her in finding the best Kickstarter for her to establish.
  
### Purpose
 The purpose of my analysis was to visually show which Kickstarter program would be the best and most successful option for Louise based on Launch dates and goals.  Having all the data in a spreadsheet allows Louise to filter any particular information she is looking for, as well as graph the information to see it visually.
  
## Analysis and Challenges
  Louise asked for specific information in which I conducted my analysis on. Louise asked for “Theater Outcomes vs Launch Dates” and “Outcomes vs Goals”. I was able to create two different worksheets using the Kickstarter data to provide Louise a breakdown of the specific information she was looking for.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- For the “Theater Outcomes vs Launch Dates”, I created a pivot chart for all the Kickstarter and then filtered by the category theater, the outcomes, the launch date, and the years. I was able to use a line graph to visually show the rates of successful, failed, and canceled shows by month. I determined that the summer months have the most successful events while the winter months had lower shows (successful, failed, canceled) overall.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- For the “Outcomes Based on Goals, I created a chart to show how many “plays” there was that was successful, failed, and/or canceled based on their goals by $5,000 increments. Using those numbers, I was able to determine a percentage for successful, failed, and canceled plays. I took those numbers and put them into a line chart for visual effects. Based on the chart and graph, I determined that the more money a goal is, it is more unlikely that you will be successful in reaching that goal.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- During my analysis, there was syntax that I was unaware of, or I was unaware how to use the syntax.  I used the documentation provided by Microsoft or I used Google for an solution.  A possible challenge that could occur while analyzing data is not receiving specific guidance from the client that they are looking for.  Working closely with your clients to determine exactly their needs will assist with your research and provide all the details the client needs.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Based on my research, the summer months (May, June, July) has the most successful shows. 2. Based on my research, December is the slowest (least) number of shows scheduled.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Based on my research, the higher the goal, the more unlikely you will be successful in reaching the goal. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. Does the currency include the exchange rate? 
2. Popularity in certain country?
3. Number of Pledges?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Outcomes Based on Pledges
2. Subcategories Outcomes
3. Subcategories by Launch Date
4. Outcomes by Currency
